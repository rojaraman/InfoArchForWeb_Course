<h3>Before the Empire</h3>
<article>
	<p>
		Rome had begun expanding shortly after the founding of the Republic in the 6th century BC, though it
didn't expand outside Italy until the 3rd century BC. In a sense then, it was an "empire" long before it had
an Emperor. The Roman Republic was not a nation­state in the modern sense, but a network of towns left
to rule themselves (though with varying degrees of independence from the Roman Senate) and provinces
administered by military commanders. It was ruled, not by Emperors, but by annually elected magistrates
(Roman Consuls above all) in conjunction with the Senate.For various reasons, the 1st century BC was a
time of political and military upheaval, which ultimately led to rule by Emperors. The consuls' military
power rested in the Roman legal concept of imperium, which literally means "command" (though
typically in a military sense). Occasionally, successful consuls were given the honorary title Imperator
(commander), and this is the origin of the word "Emperor" (and "Empire") since this title (among others)
was always bestowed to the early Emperors upon their accession.

	<p>
		Did you know? According to legend, Rome was founded by the twins Romulus and Remus, who were
abandoned at the river Tiber but were adopted and raised by a she­wolf.

<h3>The Empire is born</h3>
<p>
	Rome suffered a long series of internal conflicts, conspiracies and civil wars from the late second century
BC onwards, while greatly extending its power beyond Italy. Towards the end of this period, in 44 BC,
Julius Caesar was briefly perpetual dictator before being assassinated. The faction of his assassins was
driven from Rome and defeated at the Battle of Phillipi in 42 BC by an army led by Mark Antony and
Caesar's adopted son Octavian. Antony and Octavian's division of the Roman world between themselves
did not last and Octavian's forces defeated those of Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31
BC. In 27 BC the Senate and People of Rome made Octavian princeps ("first citizen") with proconsular
imperium, thus beginning the Principate (the first epoch of Roman imperial history, usually dated from
27 BC to 284 AD), and gave him the name Augustus ("the venerated"). Though the old constitutional
machinery remained in place, Augustus came to predominate it. Since his rule ended a century of civil
wars, and began an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity, he was so loved that he came to hold
the power of a monarch de facto if not de jure. During the years of his rule, a new constitutional order
emerged (in part organically and in part by design), so that, upon his death, this new constitutional order
operated as before when Tiberius was accepted as the new Emperor. The 200 years that began with
Augustus' rule is traditionally regarded as the Pax Romana ("Roman Peace"). During this period, the
cohesion of the Empire was furthered by a degree of social stability and economic prosperity that Rome
had never before experienced. Uprisings in the provinces were infrequent, but put down "mercilessly and
swiftly" when they occurred.The sixty years of Jewish­Roman wars in the second half of the first century
and the first half of the 2nd century were exceptional in their duration and violence.

<h3>Biography of Augustus</h3>
<article>
	<p>
		He was born <b>Gaius Octavius</b> into an old and wealthy equestrian branch of the plebeian Octavii family.
Following the assassination of his maternal great­uncle Julius Caesar in 44 BC, Caesar's will named
Octavius as his adopted son and heir. Together with Mark Antony and Marcus Lepidus, he formed the
Second Triumvirate to defeat the assassins of Caesar. Following their victory at Philippi, the Triumvirate
divided the Roman Republic among themselves and ruled as military dictators.[note 4] The Triumvirate
was eventually torn apart under the competing ambitions of its members: Lepidus was driven into exile
and stripped of his position, and Antony committed suicide following his defeat at the Battle of Actium
by Augustus in 31 BC.

	</p>
	<p>
		After the demise of the Second Triumvirate, Augustus restored the outward facade of the free Republic,
with governmental power vested in the Roman Senate, the executive magistrates, and the legislative
assemblies. In reality, however, he retained his autocratic power over the Republic as a military dictator.
By law, Augustus held a collection of powers granted to him for life by the Senate, including supreme
military command, and those of tribune and censor. It took several years for Augustus to develop the
framework within which a formally republican state could be led under his sole rule. He rejected
monarchical titles, and instead called himself <i>Princeps Civitatis</i> ("First Citizen of the State"). The
resulting constitutional framework became known as the Principate, the first phase of the Roman Empire.
</p>
<p>
The reign of Augustus initiated an era of relative peace known as the <i>Pax Romana (The Roman Peace)</i>.
Despite continuous wars of imperial expansion on the Empire's frontiers and one year­long civil war over
the imperial succession, the Roman world was largely free from large­scale conflict for more than two
centuries. Augustus dramatically enlarged the Empire, annexing Egypt, Dalmatia, Pannonia, Noricum,
and Raetia, expanded possessions in Africa, expanded into Germania, and completed the conquest of
Hispania.
</p>
<p>
Beyond the frontiers, he secured the Empire with a buffer region of client states, and made peace with the
Parthian Empire through diplomacy. He reformed the Roman system of taxation, developed networks of
roads with an official courier system, established a standing army, established the Praetorian Guard,
created official police and fire­fighting services for Rome, and rebuilt much of the city during his reign.
</p>
<p>
Augustus died in 14 AD at the age of 75. He may have died from natural causes, although there were
unconfirmed rumors that his wife Livia poisoned him. He was succeeded as Emperor by his adopted son
(also stepson and former son­in­law), Tiberius.
</p>
<p>
Did you know? Augustus' rule was so celebrated over the duration of the Roman Empire that his name
eventually transformed into a title indicating the highest monarch in the entire realm. As late at as the
15th century Byzantine emperors held the title "Augustus," although by then it had transformed into a
Greek equivalent.

	</p>
<h3>Augustus' Children</h3>
<p>Augustus, either through biological procreation or through adoption, had 5 "children:"</p>
<ul>
	<li> Julia	</li>
	<li>Gaius Caesar </li>
	<li>Lucius Caesar</li>
	<li>Agrippa Postumus</li>
	<li>Tiberias</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Did you know? Adoption was taken extremely seriously by the Romans. Even though Gaius, Lucius, and
Agrippa were Augustus' biological grandchildren, by being officially adopted they became full and
acknowledged sons of Augustus.

<h3>About the Five Good Emperors</h3>
<p>Five Good Emperors, the ancient Roman imperial succession of Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius,
and Marcus Aurelius, who presided over the most majestic days of the Roman Empire. It was not a
bloodline; Nerva was raised to the principate by the assassins of Domitian, and the others were
successively adopted heirs, each only distantly related to his predecessor if at all. The last two­Antoninus
Pius and Marcus Aureliusâ€”are often called the Antonines, though the term Antonine is sometimes
extended also to the coemperors Lucius Verus (adopted heir of Antoninus Pius) and Commodus (son of
Marcus Aurelius).
</p>
<p>
The period witnessed considerable expansion of the empire, from northern Britain to Dacia and to Arabia
and Mesopotamia. The empire was consolidated, its defenses were perfected, and a tolerably uniform
provincial system covered the whole area of the empire. The client states had one by one been
reconstituted as provinces, and even the government of Italy had been in many respects assimilated to the
provincial type.</p>
